text based games

- The first thing I did was mess around with classes. I made a simple code in python with rooms as the classes. Then put in rooms like a kitchen and had it print the location of kitchen. It is just a very simple beggining to a game. 

- Next I learned about constuctors. This includes defining a room then initializing it with def __init__ (Self, ...) This pretty much creates your object or class that you can later use to do things. After this you can put attributes by defining certain aspects of a class. This includes its name
and any other descriptors that you would want to put. The way you code these are (Self.name = ?, Self.age = ?, Self.height = ?, etc.)

- I also learned that different classes make up and object. For example when you have multiple classes like window, wall, door, roof, floor. They all come together to make the end object of a house. For this reason objects can also be called instance of a class, while the process to create this
is instantiation.
